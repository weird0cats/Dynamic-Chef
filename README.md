# Dynamic Chef mod

REQUIREMENTS:
- forge 1.12.2
- gradle 7.6.1
- forgegradle 5.1

- a decent environment needs both java 8 and 17 installed, 17 being set as the default, because the gradle wrapper I use already defaults to 8

**JUST BECAUSE IT BUILDS DOESN'T MEAN IT WORKS**

TODO
- Adding some new crops
- mod compatibility
    - rustic
    - Pam's harvestcraft(maybe, but it adds so much food)
    - food expansion
    - more that I see


DONE
- Implementing a new cooking system
- mod compatibility
    - crafttweaker
    - jei
    - should be compatible with any food mod that actually adds oredict entries
- adding new cooking stations
